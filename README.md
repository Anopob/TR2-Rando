# Usage
* Insert big update text here...

# Types
* Secrets - Randomizes locations of secrets, they are ordered based on casual play order, so you should expect to find a stone before jade.
* Items - Randomizes standard pickups (excluding Key Items, not yet implemented).
* Enemies - Randomizes the types of enemies you encounter.
* Textures - Randomly applies a texture pack to a level, using packs found in the TexturePacks folder, feel free to copy the format and add your own!
* Insert njew features added with Lahm PR here...
