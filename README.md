# Thanks
* Eycore - Lots of ideas and locations
* Nenad_ - Lots of ideas and locations
* chreden - For TRView, which has been invaluable during development and picking locations. Please visit the project at: https://github.com/chreden/trview
* b122251 - For TRMod, which was used initially to modify the levels prior to the native implementation, fantastic command-line tool you can grab here: https://core-design.com/community_trmod.html

# Usage
* Extract the release archive somewhere on your PC
* Make a backup of your original level files for safe keeping
* Start the application
* Using the File -> Open toolbar, select the directory containing the level files you want to apply the rando to.
* Enter a seed and select a randomize option, can be performed in any order and multiple times if you wish
* The changes will be applied to the specified levels.
* Copy them to your TR2 DATA folder (if they are not already) and they are ready to play!

# Types
* Secrets - Randomizes locations of secrets, they are ordered based on casual play order, so you should expect to find a stone before jade.
* Items - Randomizes standard pickups (excluding Key Items, not yet implemented).
* Enemies - Randomizes the types of enemies you encounter.
* Textures - Randomly applies a texture pack to a level, using packs found in the TexturePacks folder, feel free to copy the format and add your own!
